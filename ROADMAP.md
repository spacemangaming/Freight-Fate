# Big Rig Horizon Roadmap

## Current dev branch

- [x] Realistic freight markets and facilities: metro route nodes now expand
      into hundreds of representative shippers and receivers, with stable
      facility IDs, ship/receive cargo roles, regional specialization, curated
      source notes, deterministic offline templates, and save-compatible
      facility-aware job generation.
- [x] Playable air-brake pressure mechanics: cold starts need a short air
      build before the parking brake can release, service-brake applications
      consume air, low-air and spring-brake thresholds are spoken, and active
      trip saves preserve the air-brake state.
- [ ] Dedicated air-system audio assets: replace the current spoken
      compressor-ready cue with an air-dryer purge and low-air buzzer once the
      sound library grows those effects.

## Next up: state troopers and law enforcement

Speeding, HOS/ELD compliance, and route enforcement are now one visible
system instead of unrelated end-of-trip deductions and generic random
inspections. The first shipped slice uses route-backed contexts where the
current corridor data supports them: weigh-station POIs, construction
zones, checkpoints/high-patrol corridors, and seeded patrol windows.
Events carry evidence such as HOS/ELD violations or construction-zone
speeding, and serious HOS violations trigger an out-of-service 10-hour
reset instead of only a fine.

The ELD/HOS model is grounded in FMCSA's property-carrier summary:
11 hours of driving after 10 consecutive hours off duty, a 14-hour
driving window after coming on duty, a 30-minute break after 8 cumulative
driving hours that may be any non-driving period, and 60/70-hour cycle
rules with 34-hour restart as a future expansion. Primary references:
https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-service/summary-hours-service-regulations
and https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-of-service. ELD save data
records duty status, time, and route evidence in the spirit of FMCSA's ELD
function guidance: https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/eld-functions-faqs.

### Design sketch

- **Patrol presence.** Each route leg gets a patrol intensity from its
  region and highway (urban corridors hot, empty plains cold, construction
  zones always hot), modulated by time of day (speed traps at rush hour,
  DUI patrols at night). The CB radio is the counterplay: chatter like
  "bear at mile marker 12" gives attentive players a spoken heads-up a
  few miles out.
- **Getting pulled over.** Speeding 10+ over inside a patrol's window (or
  blowing past a weigh station while flagged) triggers a siren behind you.
  The player must signal with X (reusing the exit system's muscle memory),
  brake to a stop on the shoulder, and sit through a spoken stop: license
  and logbook check, then a ticket, a warning (reputation and demeanor
  matter), or an order to a nearby weigh station for a full inspection.
- **Consequences.** Immediate fines replace the silent at-delivery
  deduction (escalating like HOS fines: 150 to 1,200 dollars), reputation
  hits, and an "out of service" order for serious HOS violations: 10
  hours parked where you stand. Ignoring the siren is a felony stop:
  spike strips ahead, a huge fine, and possibly losing the load.
- **Settings.** The normal HOS setting now defaults to realistic, keeps
  relaxed for accessibility and pacing, and labels the non-enforced mode
  as a debug bypass rather than ordinary play. A separate law-enforcement
  setting remains open only if enforcement grows beyond HOS and route
  safety evidence.
- **Audio needed.** Siren approach/behind loops, CB radio squelch and
  chatter, an officer voice channel (the SAPI event voice fits), spike
  strip. Added as Ogg Vorbis assets under
  `src/big_rig_horizon/assets/sounds/`.
- **Open questions.** Should troopers notice damage (a visibly wrecked
  truck invites a stop)? Do warnings expire? Does reputation lower the
  ticket odds, or just the fine?

## Shipped in 1.5.0

- [x] Hours-of-service fatigue and mandatory rest planning: 11-hour
      driving and 14-hour duty limits on the in-game clock, a 30-minute
      break rule, spoken countdown warnings, inspections with escalating
      fines, and a realistic / relaxed / off setting
- [x] Rest stop menu (T): refuel, take a 30-minute break, or sleep
      10 hours while the delivery deadline keeps counting
- [x] Fatigue 0-100 with drowsiness audio cues (yawns, rumble strip
      drift) and slower hazard reactions; resets with sleep
- [x] Day/night cycle from the career clock: night ambience and music,
      sparser traffic, higher hazard risk, spoken clock time
- [x] Overnight truck parking that can fill up late in the evening:
      drive on or risk shoulder parking (poor rest, possible fine)

## Shipped in 1.4.0

- [x] Denser, real-corridor map: 59 cities and 106 legs along real US
      interstates, regional freight identity per city, no dead ends,
      full backward compatibility with old saves
- [x] Home terminal picker at career start (fully spoken, grouped by
      region, defaults to Chicago)
- [x] Regional early-career job generation: single-leg neighbor hops at
      low levels, proximity-weighted destinations, cross-country hauls
      unlocking around level 4-5

## Shipped in 1.2.0

- [x] Truck upgrades (engine tune, aerodynamic kit, long-range tank,
      reinforced brakes) and a second purchasable truck (heavy hauler)
- [x] Market fluctuations in cargo rates: per-class multipliers drifting
      daily on a seeded random walk, spoken on the job board
- [x] BASS audio backend (sound_lib) with real-time RPM-tracking engine
      pitch; pygame.mixer kept as an automatic fallback

## Shipped in 1.1.0

      (Settings -> Weather source), with seamless offline fallback

## Shipped in 1.0.0

## Future ideas (post-1.0)

### Gameplay depth
- [ ] Cargo loading/securing minigame
- [x] Hours-of-service fatigue and mandatory rest planning (1.5.0)
- [x] Highway exits: signal with X, slow for the ramp, brake to the stop
- [x] Cruise control (K), with hazard and braking auto-cancel
- [x] Region-flavored road hazards (dust devils, deer, rockfall, ...)
- [x] HOS-aware realistic deadlines (driving + breaks + sleep + slack)
- [ ] State troopers and law enforcement (designed above, next milestone)
- [ ] Special event jobs (oversize loads, urgent medical freight)
- [ ] Trailer types with handling differences

### World
- [x] More cities and regional highways (1.4.0)
- [x] Day/night cycle with audio shifts (1.5.0); seasons still open
- [ ] City-specific ambience and landmarks
- [ ] Destination-local facility legs: after the highway trip reaches the
      destination city, hand the player onto a short local approach to the
      receiver gate. Route display and GPS cues should clearly separate
      highway miles from local gate approach, saves should resume on the
      correct leg, and facility data should carry enough road name, distance,
      gate speed, and dock-approach detail to make warehouses, terminals,
      ports, and industrial yards feel distinct.

### Business
- [ ] Company ownership: hire AI drivers, buy trucks
- [ ] Loans and insurance

### Platforms and community
- [ ] Binary releases (PyInstaller) per platform
- [ ] Steam/itch.io distribution
- [ ] Localization of all speech strings
- [ ] Optional online leaderboards
